Installation Guide
------------------

Install Python
+++++++++++++++++++

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

Visit the Python for `Windows download page`_, you’ll immediately see the division.

.. _Windows download page: https://www.python.org/downloads

The website asks if you want the latest release of Python 3 (in this tutorial, we are in 3.6.4).
Download the executable.

.. warning::

   Be careful, you will need a later version of 3.5.1.

.. figure::  images/PythonPage.png
   :align:   center

Double-click ``python-3.6.4.exe`` and install ``Python 3.6.4`` .
On the first screen, enable the :ref:`“Add Python 3.6 to PATH”<add-path-label>` option and then click “Customize installation”
to verify tha the pip and py launcher installations are enabled.

   :align:   center

.. warning::

   Make sure that a version later than ``Python 3.5.1`` is well installed by using the command ``python`` into your terminal.

   .. figure::  images/PythonTerminal.png
      :align:   center

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

You just need to use this command on your terminal :

``> sudo apt-get install python3.6``

To verify that Python 3.6.1 is well installed,
you just need to run this command which should launch the Python 3 interpreter.

``> python3``

Since Python 3.4, pip is included by default. You can easily verify it by running the command :

``> command -v pip``

.. note::

   On some Linux distributions including Ubuntu and Fedora, the pip command is meant for Python 2,
   while the pip3 command is meant for Python 3.

``> command -v pip3``

Install dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++

Install pip
^^^^^^^^^^^

pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python.
To verify if pip is well installed on your system, you just need to run this following command :

``> pip -V``

.. figure::  images/pipVersion.png
   :align:   center

If pip is not installed or if you want to update it, just use this command :

``> python -m pip install --upgrade pip``

.. figure::  images/PythonInstall.png
   :align:   center

.. note::

    If you installed pip but your terminal doesn't know the pip command on Windows, maybe you need to :ref:`add pip to PATH<add-path-label>`.

Install packages using a requirements file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The project uses a text file (``./SkyEye/requirements.txt``) to defined all its dependencies.

In your terminal, change the working directory to ``./SkyEye`` and use pip to install all dependencies.

``> pip install -r requirements.txt``

.. figure::  images/PipInstall.png
   :align:   center

It's possible that some libraries failed to install, you will need to install it locally (it's the case for numpy and scipy).

Install packages locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the missing packages on this `site`_.

.. _site: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs

For example, for numpy, you will need to download the file ``numpy‑1.13.3+mkl‑cp27‑cp27m‑win_amd64.whl`` or a later version.
For scipy, you can download ``scipy‑1.0.0‑cp27‑cp27m‑win_amd64.whl``.

Then, you will be able to install it by openning a terminal on the right repository and running :

``> pip install numpy‑1.13.3+mkl‑cp27‑cp27m‑win_amd64.whl``

and

``> pip install scipy‑1.0.0‑cp27‑cp27m‑win_amd64.whl``

If the installation requires ``VC++2010`` or plus, download and install it by double-clicking on ``vc_redist.x64.exe`` (`link`_).

Launch the software
+++++++++++++++++++

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

You just need to double-click on the ``ClickMeToRun.bat`` file.

Add variables to PATH on Windows

Instruction Manual
------------------

Define Workspace
++++++++++++++++

First of all, you must define your workspace where you will work.
You can choose an empty folder (in this case, the software will generate the required folders) or use an existing one.

Your workspace must have these folders : ::

    - workspace
        - features
            - predict
            - train_features
        - machinelearning
            - evaluate
            - results
            - svm
            - train_machinelearning
        - predict-images
            - z06.tif
            - z07.tif
        - train-images
            - C1
                - z01.tif
                - z02.tif
            - C2
                - z01.tif
                - z02.tif
            - Cx
                - z01.tif
                - z02.tif
            - img
                - z01.tif
                - z02.tif

Arrange Images
++++++++++++++

The images you want to predict must be stored into ``./workspace/predict-images/``.

For the test and evaluation images, you must store them into ``./workspace/train-images/img``.
But you also need to store the binary images into the right class folder and with the same filename than the image it describes.

Extract Features
++++++++++++++++

Extract train image features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By clicking on the ``Train Base Images`` button, you will extract all the features of each black pixel (on the binary images) of each training image.
A CSV file will be created for each training image with the same filename and will be stored into
``./workspace/machinelearning/train`` for the training images and into ``./workspace/machinelearning/evaluate`` for the evaluating images.
Here an example of the CSV file : ::

    x;y;Gray;Avg3x3;Avg5x5;Avg9x9;Avg15x15;Avg19x19;MinD3x3;MaxD3x3;AvgD3x3;MinD5x5;MaxD5x5;AvgD5x5;MinD9x9;MaxD9x9;AvgD9x9;MinD15x15;MaxD15x15;AvgD15x15;MinD19x19;MaxD19x19;AvgD19x19;NumB3x3;NumD3x3;NumF3x3;NumW3x3;NumB5x5;NumD5x5;NumF5x5;NumW5x5;NumB9x9;NumD9x9;NumF9x9;NumW9x9;NumB15x15;NumD15x15;NumF15x15;NumW15x15;NumB19x19;NumD19x19;NumF19x19;NumW19x19;class

.. note:: You must define before which training images will be used to train the machine learning and the images be used to evaluate the model by clicking on the button ``Split Train || Evaluate Features``.

.. _extract-feature-predict-label:

Extract predict image features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By clicking on the ``Predict Base Images`` button, you will extract all the features of each black pixel of each predict images.
A CSV file will be created as the CSV described above but without the last column because we don't know yet which they are.

Machine Learning
++++++++++++++++

Train
^^^^^

You can training the model by clicking on the button ``Train``.

.. warning:: You must define before which training images will be used to train the machine learning and the images be used to evaluate the model by clicking on the button ``Split Train || Evaluate Features``.

Evaluate
^^^^^^^^

You can training the model by clicking on the button ``Evaluate``.
A confusion matrix will be generated, you can save it by clicking on ``Save Evaluate Result``.

Confusion matrix : ::

    [[ 762 1089 309 479 45 68]
    [ 678 1478 476 1016 53 165]
    [ 3 18 541 0 212 35]
    [ 553 1469 377 1512 38 49]
    [ 249 363 312 47 288 67]
    [ 456 1116 260 280 681 967]]

The rate recognition rate will be calculated with this matrix, it's the rate we want to improve.

.. warning:: You must define before which training images will be used to train the machine learning and the images be used to evaluate the model by clicking on the button ``Split Train || Evaluate Features``.
.. note:: You can save or load your model into the folder ``./workspace/machinelearning/svm``.

Predict
^^^^^^^

You can now predict an image by clicking on ``Predict`` and choosing the CSV of the image you want to predict into the folder ``./workspace/features/predict``.
A CSV will be generated into ``./workspace/machinelearning/results/imageName`` containing for each pixel of the image, a probability to be a pixel of the class X.

.. warning:: You must have :ref:`extracted the features of the predict image<extract-feature-predict-label>` before.

Result : ::

Viewer
++++++

View features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After choosing features by clicking on the button ``Choose 2 features``, you can view if the choice is effective or not for your training images by clicking on ``View features``.
More the samples are grouped more your choice is effective.

View Result
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Into the folder ``./workspace/machinelearning/results/imageName`` is created a result image during the prediction to summarise your results.
