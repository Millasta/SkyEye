This software present the work of the Research & Development project.
The objective of the project is to set up a system to detect archaeological remains on images derived from LiDAR data.
An approach using SVM is proposed in order to obtain the maps indicating for each pixel the probability of belonging to
a type of archaeological objects sought. To implement our approach,
this software is developed which allows to detect 5 different classes of lineaments in the LiDAR images of Chambord.
